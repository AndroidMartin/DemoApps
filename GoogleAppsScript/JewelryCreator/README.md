This is a project I was working on for a family member who has started making and selling jewelry. The idea is to have a spreadsheet based platform they can use to enter their raw materials, build and cost out finished products, track each vendor's list of goods on sale, and additional functions as they arise. Eventually, it will be built out into it's own standalone application, but the person who requested it is much more comfortable with spreadsheets, so I'm building it in Google Sheets to make the transition easier on them.

The spreadsheet itself will be in the main folder, just import it into Google Sheets. Next, you will need to add the script files by utilizing the Script Editor (Tools -> Script editor). The "Scripts" folder contains the actual Google Apps Script files created and will need to be added manually. Simply create new script files within the editor and paste the information contained in the supplied files. Then reload the file in your browser, accept the permissions, and begin using it!
