This was one of my first projects utilizing App Script and demonstrates how to integrate individual Google Calendars within a master scheduling spreadsheet.  As an executive chef, I would create my weekly schedules in the Google Sheet and my changes would automatically be added to the respective employee's Google Calendar.  This made shift changes a breeze and removed the majority of scheduling excuses I previously received.

Additionally, it would also pull in the upcoming list of events that were booked by the Function Manager, so that I had a better understanding of my needed staffing levels.  The button in the first row of the "Events" tab would refresh the list of upcoming events each week.

The "User View" and "Shift View" tabs incorporate pivot tables to display the schedule in one of two views.  The former displays when each employee is scheduled, sorted by the individual employee.  The latter displays their schedule by shift/day so that I would have a better idea of which positions are coming in, and when, for each shift.  
The "Data" tab is a list of constants that are used for calculating purposes throughout the sheet.  
The "Print" tab is what I would use to post within the kitchen for anyone to see the schedule for the next three weeks.  It also imports the confirmed functions for that time frame.  Using the drop-down in cell K1 allows the user to select the desired date range.  It also provides an estimate on the amount of dollars spent on payroll for that week.  

Knowing what I do now, I would rebuild this sheet slightly differently, but I thought it prudent to show where I started...

Be sure to save a copy for yourself before utilizing any of the functions.
