This is an application inteded to track and split financial amounts between roommates/friends.  It is mostly setup around bills, but can include other transactions as well.  There are ways to allow each person pay a different amount the "Discounts" tab.  You can add and delete "roommates" in addition to setting their move in date.  Based on the user that is logged in, it will display what is owed to each other person available.  It does NOT support payments through the app, but keeps track of balances owed.
